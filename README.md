# Bio-Vison

Welcome to our sophisticated repository designed to support a broad spectrum of image capture, processing, and analysis tasks across various domains. This repository is structured into three key components: Filters, Imaging System, and Models, each crafted to enhance the efficiency and precision of your image analysis endeavors.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three primary subfolders, each focusing on a distinct aspect of the comprehensive imaging and analysis system:

- **[Filters](https://github.com/Sami3610/BioVison/tree/main/Filters)**: Contains advanced algorithms and utilities for preprocessing images to enhance quality and reduce redundancy. Detailed information on specific filtering techniques and their applications can be found within this subfolder.

- **[Imaging System](https://github.com/Sami3610/BioVison/tree/main/Imaging_system)**: Includes both the hardware specifications and software drivers necessary for operating our advanced low-cost imaging system. This subfolder provides comprehensive guides on setting up the hardware and running the software.

- **[Models](https://github.com/Sami3610/BioVison/tree/main/Models)**: Features sophisticated machine learning models, including different series of trained models from YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, utilizing various training approaches such as transfer learning and layer freezing.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged. If you have innovative ideas, improvements for our filters, or enhancements for the imaging system and models, please send email to us.
