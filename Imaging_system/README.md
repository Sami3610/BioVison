# Overview

This repository houses the advanced low-cost imaging system, designed for efficient and precise image analysis. The system combines cutting-edge hardware components with sophisticated software drivers to capture and analyze high-resolution images for a variety of applications. This integration facilitates robust data acquisition and processing capabilities suitable for diverse operational needs.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main subfolders:

- **[Hardware](https://github.com/Sami3610/BioVison/tree/main/Imaging_system/Hardware)**: Contains all the details about the physical components of the imaging system, including setup instructions and specifications.

- **[Drivers](https://github.com/Sami3610/BioVison/tree/main/Imaging_system/Drivers)**: Includes the software needed to operate the imaging system, featuring Python-based scripts that utilize ROS (Robot Operating System) for message passing and process management.

## Features

- Dual Image Processing: Capable of handling images from two different sources simultaneously.
- GPS Integration: Combines image data with real-time GPS coordinates to tag images with precise locations.
- Dynamic Data Logging: Efficiently logs images and their metadata for later analysis.
- Adaptability and Field Readiness: Designed to be robust and adaptable for field operations in diverse environments.

## Practical Applications

This imaging system is particularly suited for ecological studies, urban planning, and environmental monitoring, enabling detailed analysis and documentation of urban vegetation. The system can be tailored to target specific tree species, aiding in biodiversity studies and city greening projects.
