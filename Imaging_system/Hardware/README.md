## A and B. Camera and lens
The Basler a2A5320-23ucBAS camera, equipped with a Sony IMX542 CMOS sensor, is characterized by its high-resolution imaging capability of up to 5328 x 3040 pixels, making it ideal for the detailed capture of urban vegetation. With its capability to operate at 23 frames per second, this 16.1-megapixel RGB camera is well-suited for urban environments, being adaptable to dynamic lighting and motion conditions. When paired with a 12mm lens, the widest field of view necessary for documenting the extensive details of urban canopies is provided. This setup ensures that comprehensive coverage and detailed capture are achieved, which are crucial for the objective of compiling a detailed visual inventory of urban vegetation, establishing the 12mm lens and the Basler camera as core components of the imaging system.
